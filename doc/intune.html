<p><br>


</p><blockquote> I grew up playing the piano, and when I was a child, I
wondered why violinists played all those funny notes. When I got a
little older, I realized that it was the violins that were in tune.
<p>
Eventually I read Helmholtz' <i>Sensations of Tone</i> and
learned the physical basis of consonance and dissonance. By then I was
working with computers and began to consider the possibly of building a
keyboard instrument that I could play in tune, in the same sense that
string quartets and <i>a capella</i> vocal groups are (or can be) in tune.
</p><p>
The software on this Web site, in combination with a MIDI keyboard, accomplishes just that.  
</p><p>
The software is written in Java and uses the Java sound extension <tt>(javax.sound.midi)</tt>. It consists of a single  package named <font color="blue"><b>intune</b></font>. It works under Java 1.5 and might work with Java 1.2 (apparently the  Java sound extension was broken under 1.3 and 1.4).</p><p>
You can use the software in two different ways. The first way allows
you to give a performance in just intonation in real time. (For more
information about just intonation, there is an entire society, <a href="http://www.justintonation.net/">The Just  Intonation Network,</a> devoted to it.) It requires an auxiliary MIDI device, in addition to the keyboard, through which you  indicate modulations.  
</p><p>
The auxiliary controller requires 13 actuators. A 13-note foot pedal
would be ideal; I'm using an extra MIDI keyboard rigged up with
key-extenders to make 13 of its keys usable as foot pedals. The 13th
actuator is used to indicate the "subdominant" tuning of the second
degree of the scale. If the tonic has frequency 1, the second may have
either frequency 9/8 (which sounds right with the dominant) or 10/9
(which sounds right with the subdominant). In the case of a dominant
7th or 9th chord, the 9/8 ratio sounds best.
</p><p>
To use the software in the second way, start the <tt>PlayTuned</tt> program using the temperament of your choice and  select the <tt>-save</tt> option to capture the performance to a disk file.  Then use the <tt>Editor</tt>
program on the saved file to insert modulation and subdominant
directives. Using the software this way requires no auxiliary MIDI
device, just the keyboard.
</p><p>
You can play the edited file with the <tt>Playback</tt> program.  You can play it as it was edited or choose to ignore  the tuning directives and apply a temperament during playback.
</p><p>
Two temperaments are included with this version, equal temperament and a temperament devised
by Thomas Young in 1799.
</p><p>    
A couple of snippets of performances captured with <tt>PlayTuned</tt> and edited with the <tt>Editor</tt> are included as  examples.
</p><p>In its present form, the software is somewhere between alpha and
beta. It works dependably, but I need to clean up the code to make it
easier to read. Also, I need to make a better interface to the
auxiliary device, so that it will be easy to slip in foot pedals or
whatever, and a better interface to temperaments, to make them even
easier to create.

<b>New </b></a><b>in this version:</b>
</p><ol>
<li>  the ability to capture a performance to disk and replay it (using the <tt>-save</tt> option of <tt>PlayTuned</tt> and  the <tt>Replay</tt> program) </li><br>

<li> an <tt>Editor</tt> that allows you to insert tuning directives after the music is captured </li><br>

 <li> a <tt>Playback</tt> program that allows you to play the output of the <tt>Editor</tt> </li><br>

 <li> support for temperaments</li><br>

<li> an expanded timbre option <tt>(-t)</tt> that allows you to select from multiple MIDI patch banks and an option  <tt>(-synth)</tt> that allows you to select the MIDI output device (useful if you have a hardware synthesizer)</li><br>

<li> programs Tun2Mid and Mid2Tun to convert from .tun to MIDI format and MIDI to .tun format</li><br>
</ol><br>
If you're willing to use the <tt>Editor</tt> to insert the tuning directives after the fact, you can forget about the foot  pedals.  Just play a piece using <tt>PlayTuned</tt> in the temperament of your choice with the <tt>-save</tt>
option on, then edit the saved file to insert the directives. Two
temperaments are included, equal temperament and a "well temperament"
devised by Thomas Young in 1799.
<p>
 The <tt>Playback</tt> program allows you to play with the tuning
indicated in the file you are playing or specify a different tuning on
the command line. Using <tt>Playback</tt>, you can compare different tunings applied to the same  performance.

<a name="Examples"><b>The Examples</b></a>
</p><p>
The Sarabande from Bach's <i>English Suite #6 in d minor</i> is interesting because of its many modulations.  They are  undoubtedly 
related to the highly dramatic character of the music.
</p><p>
The score for the first few measures of the Sarabande is shown <a href="#below">below</a>,
with markings indicating the tuning changes (modulations).
</p><p>
Try the following to compare the different sounds:
</p><p></p><pre>  java intune.Playback sarabande.tun equal 
  java intune.Playback sarabande.tun intune.ThomasYoung1799 
  java intune.Playback sarabande.tun diatonic d 
</pre><br>This will play the excerpt first in equal temperament, then
in the Thomas Young temperament, then in just intonation. I used MIDI
patch number 6 when I edited the excerpt (and when I captured it with <tt>PlayTuned)</tt>, so it will use timbre number  6 unless you override it with the <tt>-t</tt>
option. MIDI patch number 6 (or 7 if you start numbering from one
instead of zero) is used for a harpsichord sound according to the
General MIDI standard.
<p>The above commands use the default synthesizer as the MIDI output
device, typically a software synthesizer. If you have a sound board
with a hardware synthesizer, you will probably get a better sound by
selecting it as the output device (using the <tt>-synth</tt>
option). If you have a sound card that allows you to insert your own
digitized patches, you can get a harpsichord (or other) patch of your
choice and insert it at whatever bank and patch number you choose, then
select it with the <tt>-t</tt> option.  (To simulate an 
instrument with multiple manuals would require using more than one timbre, a feature not supported in this version.)
</p><p>
   To be specific, the example was captured with the command
</p><p></p><pre>     java intune.PlayTuned intune.ThomasYoung1799 -synth 6 -t 6 -save sarabande.sav
</pre><br>
and edited with the command
<p></p><pre>     java intune.Editor sarabande.sav sarabande.tun dia d -synth 6 -t 6
</pre><br>
since my hardware synthesizer is MIDI device 6.

The <tt>Editor</tt> regards the file being edited as a
sequence of items that may be MIDI messages or tuning requests. Every
item in the file has a time associated with it, and the item times are
non-decreasing as you progress through the file. When the <tt>Editor</tt>
is not playing (using the file items to generate sound), it displays
the item at the current file position and a few items before and after
it. The item at the current position is marked with asterisks.
</p><p>
The <tt>Editor</tt> responds to the following keyboard
commands, which may be abbreviated by their initial letters when the
commands begin with an alphabetic character. It is always necessary to
hit the Enter key to enter a command. Integral values are represented
by <i><tt>mmm</tt></i>, <i><tt>nnn</tt></i> or <i><tt>ppp</tt></i> and floating point values by  <tt><i>xxx</i></tt>.
Optional fields are enclosed in square brackets and different possible
values of a field are separated by a vertical bar (thus <tt>[ + | - ]</tt> means that either a plus sign or a minus sign may be entered).  <i><tt>N</tt></i>  represents a note, which may be any letter <tt>a</tt> through <tt>g</tt> possibly followed by a # or -:</p><pre>
    ('a'|'b'|'c'|'d'|'e'|'f'|'g'|'A'|'B'|'C'|'D'|'E'|'F'|'G')['#'|'-']

</pre>The lower case letters represent minor keys and the upper case
major keys (although there is no distinction between major and minor as
far as the computed intonations are concerned). The pound sign stands
for a sharp and the minus sign for a flat. <p>
The commands are:</p><pre>
    next
    previous
    delete
    insert
    modulate
    subdominant
    tempo
    go
